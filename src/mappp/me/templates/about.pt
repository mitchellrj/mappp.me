  <metal:content fill-slot="content">
    <p>mappp.me is an anonymous location-sharing service, designed to work
       with the latest smartphones as well as older devices. You can quickly
       create a short link to a map of your location and update it whenever
       you wish. Once you're done with it, don't worry, it doesn't live on the
       internet forever, it will disappear after 30 minutes of inactivity.

        <p class="question">
          I get a warning about a certificate or am told it is not valid for
          this site. What does this mean?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          This website uses <acronym title="Secure Socket Layer">SSL</acronym>
          for every page it loads. This encrypts the page and the information
          you send to the site so that other people can't sneak a look at it
          while it's travelling through the internet. Some older phones and
          other devices do not support SSL very well. Your information will
          still be encrypted, but you may get an annoying warning message like
          this.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          On some devices, you may be able to install a new "CA Certificate"
          which will make the warning go away. You can download the required
          certificate file
          <a href="http://crt.gandi.net/GandiStandardSSLCA.crt"
             title="Gandi CA Certificate file">
            here</a>.
          Installation procedure for your device will vary.

        <p class="question">
          What is this for?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          It was initially created for me to share my location on long drives,
          with someone who had a very basic phone. You could also use it to
          get people to follow you on a bar crawl, explain to friends where
          you are quickly and simply, or organise a flash mob!

        <p class="question">
          Why the 30 minute timeout?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          Locations of people are naturally transient things, in the majority
          of use cases, people don't need to know you were eating a burrito on
          the high street at 3pm last Tuesday. There are also privacy
          concerns: if you lose the admin URL and you want to delete your
          mappp, you can't. This timeout means that the past stays in the past
          and any mistakes are quickly forgotten.

          Who made this?

        <p class="question">
          Can you make it do this other cool thing? Why doesn't work on my
          Nokia 3310?
        </p>
